# Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented all the requested features for the asynchronous report generator:

### 1. ✅ Immediate Return with Unique Identifier
- **ReportService.requestReport()** now returns a UUID immediately without waiting
- Uses `UUID.randomUUID()` to generate unique tracking IDs
- No blocking - returns instantly even while reports are processing

### 2. ✅ Separate Report Task Class
- **ReportTask.java** - A dedicated Runnable class for background processing
- Simulates realistic report generation (2-5 seconds processing time)
- Implements random success/failure scenarios (20% failure rate)
- Properly handles exceptions and thread interruptions

### 3. ✅ ExecutorService for Background Tasks
- Uses `ExecutorService` with a fixed thread pool (3 threads in Main.java)
- Reports are submitted via `executorService.submit(new ReportTask(...))`
- Main application remains responsive while reports process in background
- Graceful shutdown with `awaitTermination` to let running tasks complete

### 4. ✅ HashMap for State Mapping
- Uses `ConcurrentHashMap<String, ReportResult>` for thread-safe state tracking
- Maps report IDs to their current status and details
- Thread-safe for concurrent access from multiple threads
- Query status anytime using the report ID

### 5. ✅ Multi-Report Concurrency Support
- System handles multiple simultaneous report requests correctly
- Each report maintains independent state
- No race conditions or data corruption due to ConcurrentHashMap
- Tested with 20+ concurrent requests

### 6. ✅ Comprehensive Test Suite
- **ReportServiceTest.java** with 10 comprehensive tests:
  1. **testRequestReportReturnsImmediately** - Verifies non-blocking behavior
  2. **testUniqueIdentifiers** - Ensures all IDs are unique
  3. **testInitialStatusIsPending** - Validates initial PENDING status
  4. **testReportEventuallyCompletesOrFails** - Confirms completion/failure
  5. **testQueryNonExistentReport** - Tests error handling
  6. **testMultipleConcurrentRequests** - 20 concurrent reports test
  7. **testConcurrentStatusQueries** - Thread safety validation
  8. **testCompletedReportDetails** - Verifies result details
  9. **testGracefulShutdown** - Tests proper cleanup
  10. **testStatusProgression** - Validates state transitions

## Key Components

### ReportService.java
```java
- requestReport(): Returns UUID immediately, submits background task
- getReportStatus(String): Queries HashMap for current status
- shutdown(): Gracefully shuts down ExecutorService
```

### ReportTask.java
```java
- Implements Runnable for background execution
- Simulates 2-5 second processing time
- 80% success rate, 20% failure rate
- Updates HashMap with final status (COMPLETED/FAILED)
```

### ReportStatus.java (Enum)
```java
- PENDING: Initial state when report is requested
- COMPLETED: Report generated successfully
- FAILED: Report generation encountered an error
```

### ReportResult.java
```java
- Immutable class storing status and detail message
- getStatus(): Returns current ReportStatus
- getDetail(): Returns descriptive message
```

## How to Run

### Build the Project
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

### Run Tests
```bash
mvn test
```

### Run the Application
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.report.Main"
```

Or compile and run:
```bash
mvn package
java -cp target/asynchronous-report-generator-1.0.0.jar com.example.report.Main
```

## Usage Example

1. Start the application
2. Select option `1` to request a report - you'll get a tracking ID immediately
3. Select option `2` to check status using the tracking ID
4. Initially shows `PENDING`, then changes to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED` after 2-5 seconds
5. Select option `3` to exit gracefully

## Testing Highlights

The test suite validates:
- ✅ Non-blocking request handling (returns in <100ms)
- ✅ Unique ID generation for all requests
- ✅ Thread-safe concurrent access
- ✅ Proper status transitions (PENDING → COMPLETED/FAILED)
- ✅ Multiple concurrent report handling (tested with 20 reports)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown with task completion
- ✅ Detailed error messages for failures

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Responsive**: Main thread never blocks on report generation
2. **Scalable**: Thread pool manages concurrent requests efficiently
3. **Thread-Safe**: ConcurrentHashMap prevents race conditions
4. **Resilient**: Handles failures and interruptions gracefully
5. **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios
6. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns (Service, Task, Result, Status)

## Notes

- The system uses a fixed thread pool of 3 threads (configurable in Main.java)
- Report processing time: 2-5 seconds (simulated)
- Failure rate: 20% (simulated for testing)
- All components are properly documented with Javadoc comments
